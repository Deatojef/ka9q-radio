*modes.conf* summary
====================

The following modes (presets) are defined in the current version of
*/usr/local/share/ka9q-radio/modes.conf*. See the file itself for
complete details. You may add or delete entries in this file as
needed, but be careful as it will be overwritten by the next "make
install". (This needs to be fixed).

*pm* - Phase modulation, i.e, standard amateur narrowband FM, 16 kHz
bandwidth, 6 dB/octave de-emphasis.

*npm* - Narrow PM. Like *pm* but a 12.5 kHz bandwidth.

*fm* - Frequency modulation. Like *pm* but without
de-emphasis. Sometimes called "true FM". Recommended for digital modes
such as packet, DMR, etc. Use *pm* or *npm* for conventional so-called
"NBFM" voice.

*nfm* - Narrow FM. Same as *fm* but 12.5 kHz bandwidth.

*wfm* - Wideband FM, for standard FM stereo broadcasting. Output
forced to 48 kHz stereo.

*am* - Envelope detected amplitude modulation.

*cam* - Coherent double sideband amplitude modulation, aka "synchronous" AM.

*ame* - "Enhanced" AM. Like *cam* except upper sideband only (e.g., for CHU).

*iq* - I/Q (complex) baseband output for digital demodulators or other processing.

*cwu* - CW, upper sideband. Same tone pitch as *usb* but with narrow filter centered at 500 Hz.

*cwl* - CW, lower sideband. Same tone pitch as *lsb* but with narrow filter centered at 500 Hz.

*usb* - Upper sideband. DSP filtering permits good low frequency response.

*lsb* - Lower sideband.
